# Introduction

**Hello!**

_It's me, Taylor Swift. Hi!_ No, it's not. I'm not Taylor Swift, but I do have a passion for data and I'm Social Informatics graduate. This repository is part of the practical work for my Bachelor's degree in Social Informatics. For this project, I collected data from various sources and built a predictive model to estimate how many nights Taylor Swift might perform in a given city. While this isn't a serious prediction, it was a fun and engaging challenge to tackle.

I always appreciate feedback and suggestions! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. And if you like this project, please consider giving it a star!

Additionally, if you’re working on any fun projects—_whether related to Taylor Swift_, the music industry, or data analysis—where you think I could contribute, I’d love to hear about it!

Thank you!
